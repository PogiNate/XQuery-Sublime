XQuery -Sublime
=============================

A [Sublime Text 2][sublimeText] [XQuery][] plugin.

##How to use this
Download either directly from Github or use Package Manager (always the best version.) This package enables Syntax highlighting and includes a number of snippets to make working with XQuery ([MarkLogic][] XQuery in particular) easier and faster.

##Thanks
Huge thanks to [Paxton Hare](https://github.com/paxtonhare) for the [XQuery.tmbundle](https://github.com/paxtonhare/xQuery.tmbundle). This extension is basically a fork of that project for Sublime Text 2. I'm using his `XQuery.tmlLanguage` file and all of the snippets in this extension are just `.sublime-snippet` versions of his `.tmSnippet` files.

##How You Can Help
If you want to set up some XQuery-applicable commands that would be excellent. As I work more in XQuery I'm sure I'll modify and update this extension as well.
